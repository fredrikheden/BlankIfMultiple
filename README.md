# BlankIfMultiple custom visual for Power BI

BlankIfMultiple by Fredrik Hedenström is used to be able to show/hide parts of the report, depending on whether a single item is selected or not. This can typically be used on pages where the user needs to select an item in a slicer to make the contents relevant.
